# 🚀 Lab Experience: Running a Reverse Proxy with NGINX 🧪

Today, I completed a hands-on lab focused on setting up a reverse proxy using NGINX—and what a learning journey it was! Here's a quick breakdown of the process:



✅ Installed Java and verified the version.

⚠️ Faced a compilation issue with java A — turns out the class wasn't found due to a misconfiguration.


🆕 Launched a fresh Amazon Linux 2023 instance on AWS.

📝 Created a simple A.java file using vi and successfully compiled it.

🛠️ Set up Java as an environment variable for smoother execution.

📦 Downloaded and extracted Apache Tomcat using tar.

🔧 Navigated to bin/catalina.sh to start the Tomcat server.

📊 Observed Tomcat startup logs — launched in just 1.4 seconds!

📝 Configured mysite2.conf under /etc/nginx/conf.d/ for NGINX reverse proxy.

🔒 Updated AWS Security Groups to allow HTTP traffic.

🌐 Successfully routed traffic through NGINX to Tomcat — all running on my public IP via port 80.

💡 Key takeaway: Reverse proxies not only simplify server management but also add a layer of abstraction and security.

If you're exploring DevOps or cloud infrastructure, I highly recommend trying this lab—it’s a great way to understand the moving parts of modern web deployments.
