# 🚀 LAB Update: Running a Load Balancer on NGINX using Docker 🐳


Just completed an exciting hands-on lab on setting up a load balancer using 

NGINX — here's a quick breakdown of the journey:


🔧 Step-by-step Highlights:

1.) Installed NGINX and verified installation ✅

2.) Added custom HTML content and ran the default site

3.) Checked server logs for verification

4.) Installed and started Docker, then verified available images

5.) Pulled the NGINX image from Docker Hub

6.) Launched 4 NGINX containers 🧱🧱🧱🧱

7.) Added unique text to each container to identify them

8.) Edited the nginx.conf file to configure the load balancing setup

9.) Restarted the NGINX service — and the load balancer came to life! 🎯


🌐 Testing the Load Balancer:

* Refreshed the browser and watched it route requests to:

 🔄 Container 1

 🔄 Container 2

 🔄 Container 3

 🔄 Container 4

Then updated content in Container 4 and saw the changes reflect live — it’s always satisfying to see distributed systems working as expected.

💡 A great exercise in understanding reverse proxies, Docker networking, and real-world web scaling practices.
