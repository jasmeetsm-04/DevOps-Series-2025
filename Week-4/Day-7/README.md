🔐 DevOps Weekly Series – Week 4, Day 7: Mastering Passwordless SSH on AWS EC2



In today's session, we delve into enhancing security and efficiency by setting up passwordless SSH between two Amazon EC2 instances.



🚀 Why Passwordless SSH?



Passwordless SSH leverages SSH key pairs to authenticate without manual password entry. This approach:



* Mitigates risks associated with password-based logins.

* Streamlines automation processes in CI/CD pipelines.

* Enhances user experience by reducing login friction.



🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

1. Generate SSH Key Pair on Machine 1: 

Press Enter to accept default settings.



2. Transfer Public Key to Machine 2:

Replace user and machine2_ip with appropriate values.



3. Verify Passwordless Access:

You should now connect without a password prompt.



🧰 Additional Tips

* Host Configuration: Ensure /etc/hosts contains accurate mappings for both machines.



* Permissions:Set correct permissions



SSH Service:Confirm SSH is enabled and running on both instances



📦 File Transfer with SCP

To transfer files between instances...



By implementing passwordless SSH, you bolster security and streamline operations within your DevOps workflow.
