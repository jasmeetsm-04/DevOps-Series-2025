# 🔧 DevOps Series – Week 5 | Day 10

🎯 Topic: Git – The Backbone of Source Code Management

In the world of DevOps, Git is more than just a version control tool — it's the heartbeat of collaborative development. Today, we explored Git in depth and how it plays a critical role in Source Code Management (SCM).

🧠 What We Covered:

📂 Git is the software that enables SCM

 ☁️ GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket are remote repositories — secure cloud-based folders to store and manage your code

We explored two types of version control systems:

 🔹 CVCS (Centralized Version Control System)

 🔹 DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) — Git falls under this category, giving developers a full local copy of the codebase for more flexibility and resilience.


💡 Key Learning Highlights:

✅ Initializing Git repositories and setting up identity

✅ Understanding the working directory, staging area, and commit history

✅ Creating and tracking project files through Git’s lifecycle

✅ Practicing file changes, versioning, and even reversing changes using restore

✅ Handling sensitive data and understanding the importance of deletion commits

✅ Verifying clean states with status checks (our working tree was squeaky clean!)



🧩 Why It Matters:

Git is the foundation of every modern CI/CD pipeline, enabling:

 🔁 Collaboration across teams

 📜 Traceability of changes

 🧪 Faster iterations and experimentation

 📦 Safer deployments
 
Mastering Git isn’t just a technical skill — it’s a DevOps superpower. 💪
