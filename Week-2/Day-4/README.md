🔧 DevOps Week-2 Day-4: Mastering Essential Linux Commands 🐧💻
Hey DevOps Ninjas! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

Day 4 of Week 2 in my #DevOps Daily Series is here — and we’re diving deep into the Linux commands every DevOps engineer should master. From monitoring systems to managing jobs and automating tasks, this toolkit is essential for your day-to-day.

💡 Key Topics Covered:
📌 User Management (useradd, passwd)
📌 Process Monitoring (top, ps, pidof)
📌 Job Control (jobs, bg, fg)
📌 Process Termination (kill -9) — the Thanos Snap of the command line
📌 CPU Scheduling (nice, renice)
📌 File Operations (cp, mv, rm)

🏆 ✨ Command Highlight of the Week: screen

Lost your SSH session during a critical deployment? Enter screen.
It allows you to create persistent, detachable terminal sessions — so you can resume work anytime, anywhere.

📜 Quick Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
screen -S mytask         # Create a named screen  
screen -ls               # List running screens  
screen -r <screen_id>    # Resume a screen session  
Perfect for long-running tasks, remote sessions, or keeping scripts alive across disconnects. Absolute game-changer! ⚙️

🚀 Pro Tip: Before using kill or renice, always check with ps and jobs. It could save you from nuking a critical service.
