From Commands to Control: Mastering Shell Scripting, Permissions & Sudo Power 🚀

Welcome back, DevOps explorers! 🌍 After diving into 30+ Linux commands, today we go beyond the terminal — into automation, access control, and superuser sorcery. 🧙‍♂️✨

⚙️ Shell Scripting: From Manual to Magical
Why run 10 commands when 1 script can run them all?
 Shell scripting isn’t just a DevOps skill — it’s a superpower.

🧠 Pro Tips:
