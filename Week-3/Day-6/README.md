#  🚀 DevOps Deep Dive – Week 3, Day 6

 🛠️ Logs, Networking, Scheduling & Compression – Swiss Army Knife Tools of DevOps!



Today’s deep dive was a masterclass in essential Linux tools every DevOps engineer must have in their arsenal. Whether you're troubleshooting live traffic, scanning ports, scheduling backups, or parsing massive log files, these commands are your best allies. Here's what we explored:



🔍 Reading & Analyzing Logs Efficiently :

* Live log tracking with tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

* Navigation mastery using less, more, and view for large log files



🔎 Filtering & Pattern Matching :

* grep: Find needles in the haystack using regex (^, $)

* sed: Instant find-and-replace in text files

* awk: Extract structured info from log/data files like a pro



🌐 Network Utilities :

* Discover public IP: curl ifconfig.io

* Deep DNS insights: host, dig +trace, nslookup

* Scan ports locally (netstat -plant) or remotely (nmap)



📅 Task Scheduling with Cron :

* Automate tasks with crontab -e

* Example: 04 10 * * * tar cpfz newbackup-$(date +\%F).tar.gz /etc/



🗂️ File Search & Management :

* Find files by name, size, type, or permissions with find

* Compress and preserve configs using tar, with both normal and gzip compression



📦 Bonus Tip:

 Want your backups lean and fast? Use:



CopyEdit tar cpfz newbackup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /etc/
